summary:    I'm a co-author on a paper contrasting geomorphic observations of the Mississippi and Madeira Rivers. It just got published to Journal of Geomorphology, check it out!

A few months before I left HEC, I worked with Stan and others on a 
study of the Madeira River in Brazil. The Corps (Flood and Coastal
Research & Development) was working with the Brazilian Government 
(Mobile District Brazilian initiative) on a sediment study on the
Madeira River between Manicoré and Porto Velho in Northern Brazil.
During the project, the study team discovered some interesting 
geomorphic patterns in the location and regularity of deep pools
in the Madeira River. 

Basically, we found that the pool-pool spacing 
in the Madeira has two periods. First, we found evidence of the 
classic spacing of 5-7 channel widths. This wouldn't ordinarily be 
very special, except for the fact that this period does *not*
correspond to the actual river planform (this section of the river
is actually quite straight). Second, we found a second period 
of extremely deep "mega pools" at ~40 channel widths, 
which to our best analysis seems to be driven by encounters 
with bedrock. It's a fun paper to read and has a lot of background
information on the Madeira that hasn't been published before, so
check it out!
