A few months before I left HEC, I worked with Stan and others on a 
study of the Madeira River in Brazil. The Corps (Flood and Coastal
Research and Development) was working with the Brazilian Government 
(Mobile District Brazilian initiative) on a sediment study on the
Madeira River between Manicor&eacute; and Porto Velho in Northern Brazil.
During the project, the study team discovered some interesting 
geomorphic patterns in the location and regularity of deep pools
in the Madeira River. Basically, we found that pool-to-pool spacing 
in the Madeira has two distinct periods. First, we found evidence of 
"rhythmic" pools, features developed by macro-turbulent feedbacks with
the classic spacing of 5-7 channel widths. This wouldn't 
ordinarily be very special, except for the fact that this period 
does *not* correspond to the actual river planform---this section of 
the river is actually quite straight, and meanders are much less 
frequent. Second, we found evidence of periodic, extremely deep 
"mega pools" at ~40 channel widths, which we refer to as "forced" 
features driven by encounters with bedrock. However, the regular 
spacing of these megapools is more a coincidence of regional 
geology than anything else. It's a fun paper to read and has a 
lot of background information on the Madeira that hasn't been 
published before, so check it out!
