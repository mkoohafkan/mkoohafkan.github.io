I've been with DWR for almost a year and half now, and I continue
to be involved with analyses for the
[Delta Smelt Resiliency Strategy](http://resources.ca.gov/delta-smelt-resiliency-strategy/).
In particular, I've continued to do modeling and statistical analysis
of water quality data to quantify the effects of
[operating the salinity control gates](https://water.ca.gov/News/Blog/2018/Aug-18/Researchers-Test-New-Approach-to-Improve-Fish-Habitat-in-Suisun-Marsh)
on delta smelt habitat in
[Suisun Marsh](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Regions/3/Suisun-Marsh).
One thing I've been playing with lately is looking at alternative
metrics of quantifying the habitat benefit of operating the gates,
with a particular focus on assessing changes in habitat *extent*,
rather than simply *area*, and how this might play into questions
regarding smelt population resiliency. My analysis is pretty 
half-baked right now, but I'm honing in on analyses that consider
linear measures of habitat along stream networks.

I'm working with a geographic stream network 
(the [National Hydrography Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset))
to map out Delta smelt habitat, which comes in the form of a collection of polylines.
What I really want, though, is a network---a data structure I can use to ask questions
about habitat contiguity. I also am working with water quality rasters generated by
a computer model, and I need some way to associate this data with the stream network.
ArcGIS has a framework for 
[network layers](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/networks/what-is-network-dataset-.htm),
but it seems pretty specific to transportation applications and not general network
analysis or representation.

In the end, I came up with my own process for converting a polyline layer into
the components of a network---namely, the node and edge lists. It gets a bit 
fiddly, but hopefully I've broken  the process down into something digestable.


## Some optional prep work

Depending on the application, we may need to capture the polyline geometry and 
spatial variation more explicitly in the structure of the resulting
network object. In my case, conditions changed significantly along the length
of any given polyline, so I needed many points per line in order to adequately
represent the spatial variation in conditions. I also wanted to keep the geometry
of my polylines intact, so I needed multiple points along the line in order to
capture the coordinates and curvature of the lines. I Accomplished this by 
densifying my polylines using the the ArcGIS 
[Densify](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/editing/densify.htm) 
tool. 

## Capturing network nodes from the polylines

A network is defined as collection of "nodes" connected by "edges". Logically,
the polylines will correspond to edges in the resulting network, and the nodes
are the junctions between polylines. The network nodes therefore correspond to
the polyline vertices. We need to extract the polyline vertices as a point layer
in order to generate the node list needed to construct the network. We can 
generate this "nodes" layer from the polyline layer with the ArcGIS
[Feature Vertices To Points](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/feature-vertices-to-points.htm)
tool. We want each vertex of every line to be captured only once in the output, 
so specify the argument `point_location = "ALL"`. In addition to generating an 
OBJECTID for each vertex, the resulting layer will also have a "ORIG_FID" layer 
that captures the ID of the original line segment.

Unfortunately, converting a polyline layer where individual polylines connect
will produce duplicate vertices at those junctions, because a point will be 
created *for each line at each junction*. Surprisingly, this will
happen even if we first dissolve our polyline layer into a single feature using the ArcGIS
[Dissolve](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/dissolve.htm)
tool. Instead, we need to remove duplicate points using the ArcGIS 
[DeleteIdentical](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/delete-identical.htm)
tool and use the argument `field = "Shape"` to delete duplicates based on their
location. This will remove the duplicate points, but it also means that there will
be gaps in the `OBJECTID` of the vertices layer. If you know that your graph creation
software assumes you network nodes have sequential IDs, you can fix the issue simply
by making a copy of the layer with the ArcGIS 
[CopyFeatures](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/copy-features.htm)
tool.

## Capturing network edges from the polylines

Most programs that construct networks expect an "edge list" that defines 
connections between nodes. Typically, the edge list is a two-column table
with the "from" nodes listed in the first columns and the "to" nodes listed
in the second column. We have the polylines themselves, but we need to do some
legwork in order to generate the list of "from" and "to" nodes that define
each polyline.

Things get a little fiddly if we needed to do the prep work of densifying our 
polylines, because we likely want to capture the "from" and "to" nodes of 
each *segment* of the line, not just the
start and end of the whole line. We therefore need to create a layer of
polyline segments, where each segment corresponds to a node in the network.
We can use the ArcGIS 
[Split Line At Vertices](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/split-line-at-vertices.htm)
tool to convert long polylines into many short segments.

Now that we have the segments defined, we can capture the "from" and "to" 
node lists through some repetitive use of the ArcGIS 
Feature Vertices To Points tool. We have to run the tool twice on the segments
layer: the 
first time we specify Â the argument `point_location = "START"` to capture
the "from" nodes of each line, and the second time we specify 
`point_location = "END"` to capture the "to" nodes of each line.
In both cases, the resulting layer we again have a "ORIG_FID" field 
that identifies the ID of the original line segment. 

Although we are able to identify the start and end vertices using the 
Feature Vertices To Points tool, the object IDs are not consistent between the
two layers. Since the "to" vertex of one segment is also the "from" vertex of the 
next segment, we need to use consistent IDs for the vertices in the "from" and 
"to" point layers. There are a few ways to accomplish this, but one easy way is 
to use the ArcGIS
[Identity](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/analysis-toolbox/identity.htm)
tool. Run this tool for each of the "from" and "to" point layers, specifying the
"nodes" layer from step one as the `identity_feature` argument. We really only
need to the OBJECTID of the points in the "node" layer, so we can specify the 
argument `join_attributes = "ONLY_FID"`.

The next step is to join the "from" and "to" node identifiers back to the 
polyline segment layer. Since the Feature Vertices To Points tool keeps 
information on the identity of the original polyline using the "ORIG_FID" 
field, we can use this field with the ArcGIS
[Join Field](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/join-field.htm)
tool to join the "from" and "to" node IDs back to the segments. If you don't have any additional information from the polyline
segments layer that you want to capture your network (e.g. segment length, name,
etc.) you can join the "from" and "to" layers directly on the "ORIG_FID" field.
Otherwise, you'll need to run the Join Field tool for each of the "from" and "to"
layers. You'll only need to join the field containing the IDs of the node layer,
but this field has the same name in the "from" and "to" layers; you may want to 
modify the field names of the "from" and "to" layers before joining in order to 
keep things straight. The end result is the "edge list" that defines our network
object.

## Capturing node and edge weights

We now have a node and edge list that define the structure of the network.
If the geometric structure is all we need, we can jump straight to our program
of choice (e.g. R, Python, etc.) to construct the network from the edge list.
However, it's likely that we want to capture other information to define 
properties of the network nodes and edges. 

For example, perhaps we have a raster that underlies our polyline network,
and we want to capture the raster value underlying each node in our network.
We can use the ArcGIS
[Extract Vaues to Points](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/extract-values-to-points.htm)
tool to add the underlying raster values as an attribute to each point in the 
"node" layer we generated earlier. If we want
to extract values from multiple rasters, we can use the 
[Extract Multi Values to Points](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/extract-multi-values-to-points.htm)
tool instead. One issue to keep in mind is that 
**using Extract Vaues to Points may reorder your OBJECTIDs**, 
so do this step *before* you start constructing the edge list.
If we want our network to have a spatial reference, we can also
attach the coordinates of the vertices with the ArcGIS
[Add XY Coordinates](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/add-xy-coordinates.htm)
tool.

Edge weights are only slightly trickier, and it really depends on what we want
to capture. The "edge list" layer we created earlier likely already has some
attributes, e.g. the length of each segment. We can attach other line information
too, such as the line bearing. However, if we want to get information that isn't 
directly calculable from the line---for example, the average raster value under
the line---we need to do some more legwork. One option is to assign
the average of the edge's start and end node attributes to the edge after
constructing the network. If we need to some GIS analysis to determine the
edge attributes, one option is to
generate the midpoints of each line segment via the Feature Vertices To Points
tool with the argument `point_location = "MID"`, do whatever analysis we need on
those midpoints (e.g. extract the values from a raster via the 
Extract Vaues to Points tool), and then join those fields back to the
"edge" layer using the Join Field tool.

## Constructing the network

Once we have the "node" and "edge" layers, it's (probably) straightforward 
to construct the network in the program of our choice. The exact way
to do this obviously depends on what program you're using; in R, we
can construct a network using the `igraph` package function
`graph_from_data_frame()`, which takes an edge list and node list (as
dataframes, with additional columns interpreted as edge/node attributes)
as inputs. The advantage of using R
is that we can also use the `sf` package to read the attribute tables of the 
spatial layers directly using the `sf_read()` function, meaning we don't 
need to export the attribute tables of the "node" and "edge" layers to a 
text file first.

## A demonstration

I converted these steps into an R script that uses my 
[arcpy](https://github.com/mkoohafkan/arcpy) package for R:

```r
library(arcpy)
use_ArcGIS(pro = TRUE)

arcpy$env$workspace = "example.gdb"
stream.network = "suisun_marsh_streamlines"

# densify the network
stream.network.dense = arcpy$edit$Densify(stream.network, "DISTANCE",
Â  10.0)

# split the densified streamlines into segments
stream.network.segments = arcpy$management$SplitLine(stream.network.dense,
Â  "streamlines_segments")

# generate the node list from the streamline network
stream.network.vertices.raw = arcpy$management$FeatureVerticesToPoints(stream.network.segments,
Â  "streamlines_vertices_raw", "ALL")
# delete duplicates
arcpy$management$DeleteIdentical(stream.network.vertices.raw, "Shape")
# copy to new layer to ensure incrementing OID
stream.network.vertices = arcpy$management$CopyFeatures(stream.network.vertices.raw, 
Â  "streamlines_vertices")

# get the "from" and "to" node lists from the segmented streamlines
stream.network.from = arcpy$management$FeatureVerticesToPoints(stream.network.segments,
Â  "streamlines_from", "START")
stream.network.to = arcpy$management$FeatureVerticesToPoints(stream.network.segments,
Â  "streamlines_to", "END")

# identify the original node IDs in the "from" and "to" node lists
stream.network.from.id = arcpy$analysis$Identity(stream.network.from,
Â  stream.network.vertices, "streamlines_from_id", "ONLY_FID")
stream.network.to.id = arcpy$analysis$Identity(stream.network.to,
Â  stream.network.vertices, "streamlines_to_id", "ONLY_FID")

# field renaming for future clarity
arcpy$management$AlterField(stream.network.from.id,
Â  Â "FID_streamlines_vertices", "fromFID")
arcpy$management$AlterField(stream.network.to.id,
Â  Â "FID_streamlines_vertices", "toFID")

# join the from/to IDs to the streamline segments
arcpy$management$JoinField(stream.network.segments, "OBJECTID",
Â  stream.network.from.id, "ORIG_FID", list("fromFID"))
arcpy$management$JoinField(stream.network.segments, "OBJECTID",
Â  stream.network.to.id, "ORIG_FID", list("toFID"))

# add XY coordinates to node list
arcpy$management$AddXY(stream.network.vertices)

# add raster values to edge list base on midpoint
salinity.raster = "Percent_time_lt6psu_100mG"
stream.segment.midpoints = arcpy$management$FeatureVerticesToPoints(stream.network.segments,
Â  "streamlines_midpoints", "MID")

arcpy$CheckOutExtension("Spatial")

stream.segment.midpoints.rasterval = arcpy$sa$ExtractValuesToPoints(stream.segment.midpoints,
Â  salinity.raster, "streamlines_midpoints_salinity")

arcpy$CheckInExtension("Spatial")

arcpy$management$JoinField(stream.network.segments, "OBJECTID",
Â  stream.segment.midpoints.rasterval, "ORIG_FID", list("RASTERVALU"))
```

Now that the node and edge lists have been constructed, it's trivial to
build a network object:

```r
# read in the node list and edge list
nodes = da_read(stream.network.vertices,
Â  c("OBJECTID", "POINT_X", "POINT_Y"))

edges = da_read(stream.network.segments,
Â  c("fromFID", "toFID", "GNIS_Name", "Shape_Length", "RASTERVALU"))

#construct the network
library(igraph)
g = graph_from_data_frame(edges, FALSE, nodes)

# plot with ggraph
library(ggraph)

ggraph(g, layout = "manual", x = POINT_X, y = POINT_Y) +
Â  geom_edge_link(aes(color = RASTERVALU)) +
Â  scale_edge_color_distiller("% time below 6 PSU", palette = "BuPu", direction = 1) +
Â  coord_fixed() +
Â  theme_graph()
```

Converting polylines to a network object isn't complicated, but it does 
take a few steps. It wouldn't be too hard to generalize the above process
into a function. For me, the payoff is worth it---now that I have a network
object, I can use graph theory to do some interesting analyses.
