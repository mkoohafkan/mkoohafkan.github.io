I received my degree conferral letter earlier this week, certifying
that I have
completed all degree requirements and will be conferred a Doctor of 
Philosophy degree in Hydrologic Sciences from the University of California
Davis. My PhD experience was in some ways quite different from other
students. My research was very self-driven and was not funded by any
particular grant or project, and the dissertation ended up being much
more about the *methods* I used to answer questions rather than the
answers themselves. I'm a proud that my research really was of my own
making, rather than an incremental extension of someone else's research.
But it
was also a difficult, circuitous, and often lonely road, and I came
close to quitting a few times (but that, at least, is a common
sentiment among graduate students). I learned a lot and I don't regret
the progress I've made or where I find myself now, but if I were to
have a conversation with my younger self I would probably advise
that hopeful, eager, *naive* person to do things differently. 

This post is about recognizing mistakes I made, assumptions
that turned out to be wrong, and choices I could have made if only
I'd known better. And I made some choices that turned out to be the
right ones, and those are worth sharing too. If you're reading this,
I hope that it will help you make better choices, or at least more
informed ones, so that you don't experience quite the level of 
frustration, regret, and sorrow that I experienced (although 
frustration, regret, and sorrow is unfortunately on the daily 
menu of most graduate programs). My advice is a bit biased
towards STEM programs and those of you who are *not* planning to
pursue post-doctoral research or a faculty position, but I think
most of it will apply to those of you hoping to make it in academia
as well.

## If at all possible, don't pay tuition out of pocket

Professors are writing grants all the time, and there are a lot of
projects that need doing---and they need graduate students to them. If
you can be flexible about where you live and what you are willing
to work on, I suggest you cast a wide net and follow the money, so
to speak. Whatever your field is, you probably know what the 
"big names" are, and various voices have told that those are the places
where you'll get the "best" education or work with the "pioneers" of
research. But in truth, the name brand is not worth paying for out of
pocket, and it's definitely not worth graduating with a mountain of debt.
If you look at the faculty that work at the "best" university, you'll
quickly realize that practically *none* of those faculty got their
degrees from that school. Furthermore, the quality of a school's
research program is at best unrelated to, and at worst anti-correlated
with, the quality of the school's educational program. The best
researchers often make poor teachers, and the masters of your field
probably have some really problematic personalities that makes it hard
to work with them or learn from them. Combine that with a constant
struggle for money and you'll wind up despising your program by
the end of your second year. Besides, good programs usually have funding
while bad programs don't---so a program that offers you a full ride is
probably fairly high-quality anyway. You won't ever be in a position
where you're offered funding from a bad program; a bad program will ask
*you* for money. And if you do get a funding offer,
**make sure to get it in writing**.

There are probably some exceptions to this---for example, if networking
is extremely critical to finding a job afterwards or if the program
offers something that you literally can't get anywhere else. Just do
your best to make sure you're making the choice to fund your own
education for the right reasons. I have yet to hear a convincing
argument for paying your own way through school though.
You're already losing so much money by choosing to work as an
undervalued, poorly-paid graduate student. Paying tuition on top of
that is adding insult to injury. 

I had a strong aversion to paying out of pocket, so I haven't racked up
any debt---just the opportunity cost of getting paid graduate student
wages instead of gainful employment. I had funding offers from multiple
schools, and I ended up choosing UC Berkeley for my Masters largely due
to its reputation. I don't know if that was the right choice---I didn't
have a great time in the program, and I don't think the courses were
particularly higher quality than the courses I took at UC Davis during
my PhD---but my Masters was paid for, so that's a win in the end.
I chose UC Davis for my PhD based on the funding offer as well, but it
didn't work out as well as I would have liked; My PhD funding dried up
about halfway through, in part because the
program decided to drop some key internal scholarships halfway through my
program. I made it work by getting hired as a TA or jumping
on a project here and there. A key part of my "strategy" (if you can
call it that) was working a full-time job while in school,
so I took small teaching positions (just enough to qualify for fee
remission) and applied for grants that would pay
tuition but wouldn't put food on the table. In some ways that made
me a competitive applicant because I could apply for smaller amounts
and stretch money farther than other students.
But I worked a lot of hours, and I probably could have completed
my degree earlier if I'd been able to focus on it full time. 
I actually had to pay my final quarter's
tuition up-front, and although I managed to recoup those costs through a
scholarship a few months later it still left a bitter taste in
my mouth. If I'd been facing more than one unfunded quarter, or if it
had happened earlier in my program, I probably would have dropped out.


## Avoid the "interdisciplinary" buzz

I am still attracted to jobs, organizations and groups that boast
"interdisciplinary" work. But be careful, because "interdisciplinary"
might actually be code for "we are completely disorganized and don't
know what we're doing". For example, UC Davis has interdisciplinary
"graduate groups", which are programs that are not
tied to a specific department and have participating faculty from a wide 
variety of fields. Unfortunately, not being tied to a department means that
the group doesn't have access to the resources of *any* department, and as
a student you might not even have access to your *advisor's* department.
That means that you might not have access to teaching positions and internal
funding that are reserved for the students of a given department.

Student support is better managed and supported by established departments;
they have probably existed for longer and have a stronger foundation in the
university administration. They may also have grants or endowments that support
students, or offer more classes and thus more TA positions. Interdisciplinary
"graduate groups", in contrast, are probably relatively new programs, are fairly
small, and are likely to offer fewer resources. On top of that, throwing a bunch
of faculty members from different departments can make academic politics even worse
and limit opportunities for you to collaborate with other groups. Besides, just
because the department or lab doesn't have the word "interdisplinary" in the name
doesn't mean you can't still do interdiscplinary work. PhD research can
easily transcend the typical field or research focus of a department, and
you can always take classes outside of your department!

I joined an "interdisciplinary" graduate group that I could not in good
conscience recommend to anyone, and I probaby would have been happier if
I had applied to my advisor's home department rather than through the
graduate group. I ended up taking almost of all of my
classes from outside the program anyway (primarily the civil engineering and
statistics departments) and many of the classes that my program
advertised on its web page turned out to be on a six-year rotation
or longer (i.e., you could finish a PhD before that class was ever
offered), and in some cases *had only ever been offerred once*.
The small number of classes also meant that few TA positions
were available for students in the group. Furthermore, there was
limited internal funding and scholarships. contrast that with e.g.,
the Civil Engineering department, which had teaching positions
reserved for engineering students and had enough money that they
would sometimes reach out to students *unprompted* to 
ask if they needed funding. Which situation would you rather be in?


## Seek out a project that is already funded

Chasing funding isn't fun. Spending time writing grants to fund your
research means you have less time to *actually do research*, and more of
your proposals will be rejected than receive funding. Similarly, teaching
while doing research is hard and more teaching means less time to
*actually do research*. If you can, seek out a project that someone else
already wrote a successful grant for and now has money waiting to be
spent on a fresh new PhD student. An advisor offering "a year of
funding" or "a combination of research and teaching positions" means
that at some point you'll be writing grants for months straight or
grading 200 exams on Christmas eve, all for the privilege of dragging
out your PhD by another year or two. The other benefit of a funded
project is that both you and your advisor will have some idea of what
the final form of your dissertation will look like, and what the major
milestones of the research are. And again, if you do get a funding offer
**make sure to get it in writing** (gee, did I already say that?).

I also recommend this approach because it can be really hard to figure
out what you want to do, or even what is doable. You're not an expert
when you start out a PhD (that's *kind of the point*) and you likely
don't know what has already been done, what research is feasible,
and what resources you'll need to complete it.

Neither I nor my advisor had a specific project in mind when I
started my dissertation, and while my first year was fully-funded there
was an understanding that future work would be funded by teaching
positions and various long-term contracts that my advisor had with local
and state agencies---meaning that I knew at least some of my work
wouldn't tie directly into my dissertation, or that I'd have to put in
some extra effort to glue it all together. I didn't actually know
what my PhD really was until my final year, and I had a lot of doubt
about what I was doing for most of the journey. I think I would have
been happier and more relaxed if had been hired for a specific
project. My PhD was challenging and I often felt like I was trying to
steer a rudderless ship---but I was also really lucky to have an
advisor who was interested and willing to support me through my PhD
even when my interests took me outside of his typical research field.
It would have been far worse to be hired onto a project and later
realize that I thought was boring and that I didn't want to specialize
in that field---which is sort of what happened during my Masters
program, and why I decided to go elsewhere rather than stay for a PhD
and pigeonhole myself into a field I didn't care about.

## Seek out a project that lets you interact with industry

This is particularly important if you're planning to 
work outside of academia---e.g., as a consultant or
employee of a government agency or NGO. The time you
spend doing a PhD is time you could otherwise spend
working in industry. If your goal is to work in 
government, that also means lost time in position
(and thus a longer time before you're eligible for
promotion) and lost time in any pension fund that might
be available (which you're probably not thinking about,
but *maybe you should*). A PhD is not strictly required
for a lot of government positions---even research-oriented
ones---so spending 4 years doing a PhD probably won't be
as valuable to hiring managers as 4 years actually working
the job.

On the other hand, being a student can open doors and
provide shortcuts. Many agencies have 
internship programs (one good example is the Federal 
[Pathways Program](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/students))
which are only open to students, including graduate students. These
programs can be a mechanism for agencies to collaborate with
universities on projects that have a need for advanced research or
scientific analysis that isn't common among government employees.
In other words, it's possible to be hired through one these programs
to do research *that you would be doing anyway*. If you can make
that happen, you'll be miles ahead of your fellow students because 
you'll have been racking up bona fide work experience while you were
doing your PhD. You'll also have contacts in the agency who are willing
to recommend you to colleagues, and maybe even a job lined up and
waiting for you when you graduate. For example, the Pathways
Internship Program generally
provides for student interns to be converted to regular employees
once they complete their studies (on the flip side, you have to resign
if you quit your degree without finishing). 

In my case, I worked on projects that gave me a way in to
agencies that I wanted to work with after graduating. I
pushed to get involved with a research office that was
able to hire me through their internship program in order
to work on the project as their employee on top of my
involvement through the university. I also was able to
develop professional contacts from other collaborating
agencies, which produced opportunities years later that
I never expected. My internship also qualified as engineering
work experience, which meant I was able to get licensed as
a Professional Engineer before I graduated.

## Avoid the non-tenured advisor

Being the student of an assistant professor, i.e., a new
professor pursuing tenure, is tough. Although they may be
more in touch with the cutting edge of their field
and more sympathetic to the trials and tribulations of
modern-day graduate school, a newly-minted professor
brings a whole lot of baggage to the
student-advisor relationship that you should probably avoid
like the plague. They have about as
much experience advising students as you do and are
struggling to spin up their research enterprise, rabidly
chasing funding and frothing at the mouth to publish papers and
prove to their department that they deserve tenure. They
also will be learning the hard way how their department
(dys)functions and getting repeatedly slapped in the face
by academic politics. Those issues will trickle down to you
whether you like it or not, and whether the professor means
to let it happen or not---and you will face more pressure than
the students of tenured professors while likely also receiving
less or worse guidance (which is not to say tenured professors
can't be terrible---they definitely can!).

Rather than tag along on the miserable journey
that is the tenure track, seek out an advisor who has already
run the gauntlet and isn't counting on your performance to give
them job security. A seasoned professor will know how their department
operates, will have learned from their previous mistakes guiding PhD
students, and be able to avoid at least some of the traps that can
ruin your graduate studies and will have the resources of an
established research program to back you up if things go wrong.
But perhaps most importantly, they won't take your struggles as a
personal failure or conflate them with their own issues. 

The only exception to this that might be worth considering is if
(1) the tenure-track has *already landed* a multi-year grant with
an established research scope that will fund your entire PhD, and
(2) the tenure-track advisor only has a few students and has instead
packed their lab with post-docs who can help out in a research
advising role. But those situations are probably about as common
as unicorns.

My advisor during my Masters was an assistant professor who had
started only a few months prior to my enrollment, and it was a rocky
road. I wasn't the student she needed (although I think what she
really needed was a post-doc) and she wasn't the advisor I needed.
I felt a lot of pressure to perform but I also felt like my advisor
didn't have time for me. My PhD advisor, on the other hand,
has guided many students to graduation over the years and has been
a tenured faculty for a long time---and while he was pretty hands-off
at times, I never felt like I was bothering him by asking for guidance
and he never brought other stress or baggage to our meetings. In
fact, he was comfortable enough with his research enterprise and
status in the university to let me do my own thing and take risks
that a tenure-seeking professor probably would *not* have supported.
I'm really thankful that I had a healthy and professional relationship
with my advisor---there are way too many examples of horrible and
unhealthy student-advisor relationships, and I know too many students
who quit their program because they couldn't handle the pressure
that their tenure-track advisor
put on them to publish papers and secure grants for the lab.

## Try to do some recon on your potential advisor

The student-advisor relationship can make or break a PhD, and you
owe it to yourself to find out what kind of person your potential
advisor is and how they treat their students. You should definitely
talk to your potential advisor's current students; the advisor will
probably suggest this themselves or be willing
to organize a get-together, especially if they consider you
competitive applicant. Otherwise, a prospective students
gathering---something often arranged by departments and
graduate programs---will give you a chance to do some
digging. Unfortunately, current students---especially those early in
the program---will still be drinking the kool-aid, so to speak. They
will probably have a pretty rosy view of the program and their advisor
and still be in denial about the issues they being faced with. You'll
get a better picture of your potential advisor by talking to
the soon-to-be or recently-graduated students, but these students
probably won't be showing up to the mixer. it feels awkward, but
honestly you will probably have decent success by just emailing those
late-stage students and frankly asking about the advisor. You can
probably find student contact info by looking at your potential advisor's
recent publications, or just comb through the program directory. 
If things went bad, those students will probably be all too eager to
tell you about it.

I was lucky to meet PhD students while I was doing my Masters who
had my future advisor on their committees, and they were able to
give me a pretty good idea of what to expect when I mentioned I was
considering joining his research group. And they all had
good things to say about him but also a few complaints,
which gave me confidence that they were providing a realistic
assessment of him. I made an informed decision when I chose my
advisor, and I think it was the right one.


## Choose the "easy" committee members

During your program, you'll learn that some professors have a
reputation for being "easy" or "nice", as if those qualities
are a bad thing. Grad students for some reason become masochists
early in the program and convince themselves that they *want* a
trial by fire. Don't be like that. Academia is a terribly subjective
environment, where goal posts are constantly moving and people change
their minds about months worth of work in a day. Choosing advisors
and committee members who can support you and teach you is great, but
you should also pick faculty who acknowledge the flaws in the system
and recognize that their job is to help you graduate without wasting
too much time or money. Looking down on a professor because they won't tear
your work to pieces and make you cry is one of the dumber attitudes
you'll come across in graduate school. One of my colleagues (who 
completed his PhD many years ago) once said something to me that really
resonated with what I had seen and experienced in graduate school:
"academics are so vicious because they are fighting over so little."
(this turned out to be a variation of 
[Sayre's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre%27s_law)). Try to
rise above that, and find professors who also have risen above
that---try to avoid packing your committee with people who are
willing to fight to the death over scraps, or at least don't
*seek them out*.

At the end of the day, your dissertation is approved or rejected
depending on the opinions of 3-5 people. They are not infallible.
They are probably neurotic. They may be completely out of touch.
And even if they are leaders in their field, they are still just
big fish in a small pond, and maybe not even in the same pond as
you. In the grand scheme of things their opinions matter very little.
However, they have a whole lot of power over **you**,
so pick people who can at least *be nice*
and actually care about whether you complete your dissertation or not.

I didn't exactly choose the "easy" professors, but I avoided professors
with bad reputations when choosing my committee---even if they were
idolized as pioneers of their field. I still got a few surprises
and my qualifying exam ended up being challenging anyway, so I think
I (mostly) made the right decisions.

## Try teaching at least once

In a way, this directly conflicts with my previous advice about
funding; if you have a funded project you'll probably never have to
teach. For me though, teaching was one of the best parts of my
dissertation. I personally enjoy teaching so your mileage may vary,
but one of the most interesting things about teaching is that
*it makes you more of an expert*. Teaching really helped crystallize
some of the fundamental concepts in my field and made me develop
a level of comfort and familiarity with the mechanics of
problem-solving---and explaining things to others---that I absolutely
would not have otherwise. It's a great way to practice thinking on your
feet, communicating complex concepts, anticipating questions, and 
public speaking in general---skills that will benefit you in
virtually any profession.
It's also good to interact with undergraduate students and remind
yourself how you felt about school *before* graduate school dragged
you into the pit. You'll have an opportunity to be a mentor and maybe
give the advice you wish someone had given you.

I enjoyed teaching so much that I *still* sometimes think I'd like to
be a professor. I find it really fun and rewarding, and even in my
current job I look for opportunities to teach workshops and do
demonstrations. Maybe someday I'll find myself looking for
teaching-focused faculty positions at a small liberal arts
college... but probably not.


## Is a PhD worth it?

Well... I don't know. When I started my PhD, I thought I wanted to
work in academia, become a professor and teach and do research. It
took a few years of a PhD program for me to realize that I
*absolutely did not want that*. And I'm happy with my career
and what my options are, but they don't technically require a PhD.
However, being a PhD student was what got me the internship that
helped me get the job that helped me get the next job. I got to
work on really interesting projects that I probably wouldn't have
been able to otherwise. And my experience as a PhD student taught
me to be more of a self-starter than many of my colleagues and
made me develop skills that they don't have.

Then again, how much of that is my PhD and how much of it is my Masters?
I think I would have still ended up in the same field, doing similar
work, if I just had a Masters degree. I wouldn't have had the exact
same work opportunities, but I would have probably had similar
ones---and
I would likely be in a more senior position by now. But you never
know, the dissertation may give me a leg up in a future job
application or open a door that otherwise would remain closed to me.

So I guess I would say: definitely get a Masters degree if you want
to work in
industry, you will learn a lot and it is a major step up from a 
Bachelors degree. But don't take more than two years to do it, and
try to get someone else to pay for it. And don't turn your nose up
at non-thesis Masters programs; graduate coursework is really valuable
on its own, and doing a full thesis doesn't add much value to industry
work (you'll get enough project management experience on the job,
and project management in industry is very different from research
project management). Doing a full thesis can be risky because research
delays, failed experiments, etc. can really drag out a Masters degree.

If you want to work in
academia... well, you'll need a PhD for that. Just try to remember
that the PhD is the *first step*, not the end goal, and try to make
choices that will help you fast-track your dissertation. My advice
regarding a funded project stands, but also
consider that grant and proposal writing will be a major part of
your job as a professor, so you'll want to make an effort to practice
those skills as a student. One good approach might be to jump on a
funded, planned-out project but practice proposal and grant writing
along the way by pitching enhancements and auxiliary projects that
will make your research better, but aren't strictly required to
complete the work.

If you don't know if you want to work in industry or academia,
or think you'd be happy either way, then
your best option might be to try to go straight to a PhD from
a Bachelors degree. It sounds counterintuitive, 
but most PhD programs will force you to complete the
requirements of a Masters degree along the way; if you
start a PhD program and later decide it's not for you, you'll have
the option to gracefully bow out but still take a Masters degree with
you. This will help take the edge off of any pain or bitterness you
might feel about your "failed" PhD and you won't have to awkwardly
explain an unfinished PhD during job interviews (just pretend you
were only going for a Masters degree all along!).

But hey, at least I can be really annoying and make people call me
"Doctor" now. That's worth it, right? Right?
