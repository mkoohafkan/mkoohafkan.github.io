A number of years ago, I ran some laboratory experiments in a
["fog box"]({% post_url 2013-05-23-the-fog-box %}) to 
develop a relationship
between voltage outputs from leaf wetness sensors and measured 
dew deposition on leaf samples (see some of my 
[earlier]({% post_url 2013-07-19-measuring-leaf-area-with-matlab %}) 
[posts]({% post_url 2013-09-13-leveraging-laboratory-data-with-r %}) 
on how I went about doing that). We wrote up a manuscript on our findings 
but we never ended up publishing, and as my interests shifted to 
geomorphology I lost motivation to pursue the work.

Thankfully, there are others more committed to the field. I was recently
contacted by 
[Cynthia Gerlein-Safdi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-gerlein-safdi-a13b6a9a/), a 
PhD student at Princeton University working with 
[Kelly Caylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellycaylor/)
(now at UC Santa Barbara). Cynthia had been collaborating with 
[Sally Thompson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sally-thompson-686641123) 
(my Masters research advisor) on a dew deposition model. 
Cynthia used the findings from my fog box experiment 
to transform the voltage outputs of leaf wetness sensor data from 
the Blue Oak Ranch Reserve field station to actual water mass,
and used the results to validate the model. 
The manuscript was just published and it's pretty neat stuff, 
so [check it out](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325604519_Dew_deposition_suppresses_transpiration_and_carbon_uptake_in_leaves)!
