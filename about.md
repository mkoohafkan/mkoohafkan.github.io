I am a PhD student in the 
[Hydrologic Sciences Graduate Group](http://hsgg.ucdavis.edu/) 
at University of California Davis and a Hydraulic Engineer at the 
[USACE Hydrologic Engineering Center](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/). 
My doctoral research is focused on sediment 
transport and geomorphologic processes in large braided sandbed rivers,
with particular emphasis on the morphodynamics of emergent sandbars in the 
Missouri River. 
I started the doctoral program in late 2014 following completion of a 
Masters of Science in 
[Environmental Engineering](http://efmh.berkeley.edu) 
at University of California Berkeley, where I studied the role of fog in the 
hydrology of 
coastal watersheds in California. I have also collaborated with NOAA's 
[Habitat Blueprint](http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/habitatblueprint/) 
to explore hydrologic controls on salmonid habitat quality in the 
[Russian River estuary](http://www.scwa.ca.gov/russian-river-estuary/), 
and with the 
[American Bird Conservancy](https://abcbirds.org/) 
on the development of an 
[agent-based model](http://www.leasttern.org/) 
of Interior Least Tern breeding behavior.
