Hi there! My name is Michael. I'm a Water Resources Engineer with the 
California Department of Water Resources
[Division of Environmental Services](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services). 
I provide modeling and data analysis support for special studies relating to
water resources management, ecosystem function, and habitat restoration, with special
focus on the Suisun Marsh and Bay-Delta.
I do all kinds of work involving hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and
water quality as well as remote sensing, statistics, and GIS analysis. More recently,
my work has involved the management and analysis of "big" environmental data and
large longitudinal datasets from long-term environmental sensor networks.
Prior to joining DWR, I worked with the 
[USACE Hydrologic Engineering Center](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil), 
where I worked with the [HEC-RAS](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras) 
software development team to design and implement sediment transport 
modeling features. During that time I also provided support to
USACE regional offices on projects involving bed, bank and floodplain 
geomorphic processes in large sand-bed rivers, and helped teach
HEC modeling courses in the
[PROSPECT](https://ulc.usace.army.mil/)
program. 

I have a Doctor of Philosophy degree in
[Hydrologic Sciences](http://hsgg.ucdavis.edu)
from the University of California Davis.
My doctoral research focused on using graph theory to represent 
and analyze spatial and temporal interactions between landscape features.
I developed a novel graph-theoretic approach and used it to 
study the morphodynamics of emergent sandbars in the Missouri River
in collaboration with the 
[Missouri River Recovery Program](https://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/mrrp/efforts-actions/esh), 
and model salmonid habitat utilization in the Russian River Estuary
in collaboration with NOAA's 
[Habitat Blueprint](https://www.habitatblueprint.noaa.gov/habitat-focus-areas/russian-river-california/).

I started this blog while working on a Master of Science degree in 
[Environmental Engineering](http://efmh.berkeley.edu) 
at the University of California Berkeley, where I studied the role of
fog in the hydrology of coastal watersheds in California. Before that,
I completed a Bachelor of Science in
[Environmental Resources Engineering](https://engineering.humboldt.edu)
at Humboldt State University. During my last year in the undergraduate
program, I worked for
[Lang, Railsback & Associates](https://langrailsback.com)
on a joint project with the
[American Bird Conservancy](https://abcbirds.org)
and the 
[Engineer Research and Development Center](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil)
on the development of an 
[agent-based model](https://erdc-library.erdc.dren.mil/xmlui/handle/11681/2905) 
of Interior Least Tern breeding behavior. 

Mostly though, I write code. I love using computer programming to 
solve problems and improve workflows. I'm passionate about 
visualizing data and using computers to communicate science. 
I'm all about using the right tool for the right job
(as long as I can automate it!) and love to teach my methods, so 
my blog mostly explores approaches to solving programming 
problems in a variety of languages (along with some shout-outs
to publications and presentations I'm involved in).
