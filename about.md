I am a Water Resources Engineer with the 
[California Department of Water Resources](https://water.ca.gov),
[Division of Environmental Services](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services). 
I provide modeling and data analysis support for special studies relating to
water resources management, ecosystem function, and habitat restoration, with special
focus on the Suisun Marsh and Bay-Delta.
I have wide-ranging expertise in hydrodynamic, sediment transport, and
water quality modeling as well as remote-sensing and GIS analysis. More recently,
my work has involved the management and analysis of "big" environmental data and
large longitudinal datasets from long-term environmental sensor networks.
Prior to joining DWR, I worked with the 
[USACE Hydrologic Engineering Center](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil), 
where I worked with the [HEC-RAS](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras) 
software development team to design and implement sediment transport 
modeling features. During this time I also provided support to
USACE regional offices on projects involving bed, bank and floodplain 
geomorphic processes in large sand-bed rivers. 

I am also a PhD candidate in the 
[Hydrologic Sciences Graduate Group](http://hsgg.ucdavis.edu) 
at University of California Davis and 
My doctoral research is focused on using graph theory to represent 
and analyze spatio-temporal interactions between landscape features.
I apply a novel graph-theoretic approach to studying the 
morphodynamics of emergent sandbars in the Missouri River and to
assess habitat patch evolution in the Russian River Estuary. 
I started the doctoral program in late 2014 following completion of a 
Masters of Science in 
[Environmental Engineering](http://efmh.berkeley.edu) 
at University of California Berkeley, where I studied the role of fog in the 
hydrology of 
coastal watersheds in California. I have also collaborated with NOAA's 
[Habitat Blueprint](http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/habitatblueprint) 
to explore hydrologic controls on salmonid habitat quality in the 
[Russian River estuary](http://www.scwa.ca.gov/russian-river-estuary), 
and with the 
[American Bird Conservancy](https://abcbirds.org) 
on the development of an 
[agent-based model](http://www.leasttern.org) 
of Interior Least Tern breeding behavior.
